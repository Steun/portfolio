While some others in my team focussed on the API, I worked mostly on the design, user experience and front-end of the app. A very important part of the application was the user accessibility. I devoted a big portion of my project time perfecting this. We worked in Agile Scrum sprints during this project.',

A Raspberry Pi 3, hooked up to a magnetic switch positioned in the doorpost with a tiny magnet on the doorlock pin is how we pulled it off. The Raspberry Pi with a bit of Python software is connected to an API. I use the API to show all the data in the Progressive Web App. Another neat thing is that we\'ve implemented WebSockets. This means that you don\'t have to refresh the page to see whether the toilet status has changed.',

      'The residents there engage in activities and chores like cleaning and cooking while being assisted by the employees. This requires a lot of guidance.\n\n Unlike with dementia, some research has proven that with the help of a step-program, it is possible to perform tasks, and eventually tasks can be re-learnt.' +
      ' This is where Hap Hap comes in. Residents are each given a tablet which shows simple step-plans assigned to them by employees. Since cooking often has a lot of difficult steps, recipes can be created and divided into sub-tasks by employees which then can be assigned to separate tablets.',
    infoTitle2: 'The result',
    infoText2: 'The application is divided into two parts. On the resident side of the application the user only sees the task the employee has assigned to that user. On the employee dashboard, the employee can create recipes and tasks, start cooking sessions, assign tasks to users and see the current progress of the recipe and its connected users status. \n' +
      '\nUsing WebSockets technology, HapHap is able to instantly update the status and progress of devices. This gives employees great power and insight in what people are currently doing, and allows for less employees needed to guide residents.',
